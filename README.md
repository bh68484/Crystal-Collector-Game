# Crystal Collector Game

The Crystal Collector game runs in a web browser using HTML and JavaScript. Match the crystal counter to the number to match to win the game. Values are randomized each game.

## How to Play

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your crystal counter.
You win the game by matching the crystal counter to the number to match. You lose the game if your crystal counter goes above the number to match number.
The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal and generate a new number to match.
